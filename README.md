Hugo "The King" Reyes 

	Yes, the legend is true. I have been programming for about 5 years now and it now feels like I've been doing it forever. I dont mind that. I worked hard for a long time to be able to get into flow states while I engineer software after I discovered the psycholigical phenomenon known as "flow". Mihaly Czikzenmihaly's book Flow The Optimal Experience was an enlightening read and i recommend it hands down if youre interested in reaching these states of consciousness. Anyway, I'm getting ahead of myself. My first expereince with programming was a tutorial I found for a project with php and html off this one forum when i was in the 9th grade in high school. I didnt really understand the code that i was working with but i just kinda figured it out and when the website worked I was like "woah this code creates this functionality? and what I wrote/configured was actually correct enough to work? thats kinda really cool." Not going to lie, I was pretty impressed by myself. Thats what sparked my hidden talent and so I studied Computer Science at Cal State Dominguez Hills.  
The following is a list of some of my former expexperiences and skillsets:
